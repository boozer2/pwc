Plant Watering Controller

Work in progress. Pre-alpha.

TODO:
    Save last watering timestamp using globals (see https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-to-restore-template-sensor-on-reboot/391362/6)
    Convert to using "sprinkler" controller component - but can it be made more modular (instead of having to repeat code for each valve)?
    Watering Schedule
    Moisture sensor
    Automatic provisioning - use MAC instead of PWC#?
    Possible to update plant names (which are presented to HA) on ESP without recompiling?
